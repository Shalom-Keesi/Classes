//You are working on a web application for a car rental company. They want to keep track
// of their car inventory and rental information. Your task is to create a JavaScript class or
// function constructor for representing cars in their inventory and another one for
// representing rental information.
// Requirements:
// 1) Create a Car class or function constructor that has the following properties:
// a. make (string): The make of the car, e.g., "Toyota".
// b. model (string): The model of the car, e.g., "Camry".
// c. year (number): The year the car was manufactured, e.g., 2020.
// d. isAvailable (boolean): Indicates if the car is currently available for rent.
// The Car class or function constructor should also have a method called
// toggleAvailability that changes the isAvailable property to its opposite value (true to
// false, false to true)


function Car(make,model,year,isAvailable){
    this.make = make;
    this.model = model;
    this.year = year;
    this.isAvailable = isAvailable;

    this.toggleAvailablity = ()=>{
        if(this.isAvailable==this.isAvailable){
            console.log("Car available")
        }
        else if(this.isAvailable!=this.isAvailable){
            console.log("Car not available")
        }
        else{
            console.log("Invalid")
        }
    }
}
const subaru = new Car("Subaru","X5",2023,true);
console.log({subaru})
subaru.toggleAvailablity()

// Create a Rental class or function constructor that has the following properties:
// ● car (Car object): The car that has been rented.
// ● renterName (string): The name of the person who rented the car.
// ● rentalStartDate (Date object): The start date of the rental period.
// ● rentalEndDate (Date object): The end date of the rental period.
// The Rental class or function constructor should also have a method called
// calculateRentalDuration that returns the rental duration in days.

class Rental {
    constructor(car, renterName, rentalStartDate, rentalEndDate) {
      this.car = car;
      this.renterName = renterName;
      this.rentalStartDate = rentalStartDate;
      this.rentalEndDate = rentalEndDate;
    }
  
    calculateRentalDuration() {
      const startDate = this.rentalStartDate.getTime();
      const endDate = this.rentalEndDate.getTime();
      const millisecondsPerDay = 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24;
      const durationInMilliseconds = endDate - startDate;
      return Math.ceil(durationInMilliseconds / millisecondsPerDay);
    }
  }
  
  const toyota = new Car("Toyota", "Camry", 2020, true);
  const mazda = new Car("Mazda", "Imprenza", 2016, false);

  
  const rental1 = new Rental(toyota, "Kamau", new Date("2023-11-01"), new Date("2023-11-12"));
const rental2 = new Rental(mazda, "Kinuthia", new Date("2023-08-10"), new Date("2023-08-12"));

console.log(rental1.calculateRentalDuration()); 
console.log(rental2.calculateRentalDuration());


// Create an instance of the Car class or function constructor for a car in the inventory.
// Then, create an instance of the Rental class or function constructor for a 
// rental involving the car you created.
// Finally, calculate the rental duration using the calculateRentalDuration method.

const probox = new Car("Probox", "Az", 2020, true);
const rental = new Rental(probox, "Kinyanjui", new Date("2023-01-01"), new Date("2023-02-01"));
const rentalDuration = rental.calculateRentalDuration();
console.log("Rental Duration:", rentalDuration, "days");




// You are building a simple quiz app that contains multiple-choice questions. 
//Your task is to create two JavaScript classes: Question and Quiz. 
//The Question class will represent individual questions, and the Quiz class will manage a 
// collection of questions and the user's progress. 
// 1. Create a Question class with the following properties: 
// ● text(string): The text of the question. 
// ● options(array): An array containing the multiple-choice options.
//   ● correctAnswer(string): The correct answer to the question. 
// The Question class should also have a method called checkAnswer that takes a 
//user's answer as a parameter and returns true if the answer is correct and false otherwise. 

class Question {
    constructor(text, options, correctAnswer) {
    this.text = text;
    this.options = options;
    this.correctAnswer = correctAnswer;
  }

  checkAnswer(userAnswer) {
    return userAnswer === this.correctAnswer;
  }
}



const question1 = new Question(
  "How many stars are in the American flag?",
  ["50","35","100","55"],
  "50"
);


const userAnswer = "35";
console.log(question1.checkAnswer(userAnswer));


// Create a Quiz class with the following properties: 
// ● questions(array):An array of Question objects. 
// ● currentQuestionIndex(number): The index of the current question in the questions array. 
// ● score(number): The user’s current score. 
// The Quiz class should have the following methods: 
// ● addQuestion: Takes a Question object as a parameter and adds it to the questions array. 
// ● nextQuestion: Advances to the next question in the quiz by incrementing the currentQuestionIndex. 
// ● submitAnswer: Takes a user's answer as a parameter, checks if the answer is correct using the 
// checkAnswer method of the Question class, and updates the score if the answer is correct.

class Quiz {
    constructor() {
      this.questions = [];
      this.currentQuestionIndex = 0;
      this.score = 0;
    }
  
    addQuestion(question) {
      this.questions.push(question);
    }
  
    nextQuestion() {
      this.currentQuestionIndex++;
    }
  
    submitAnswer(userAnswer) {
      const currentQuestion = this.questions[this.currentQuestionIndex];
      if (currentQuestion.checkAnswer(userAnswer)) {
